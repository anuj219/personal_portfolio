i know this transition applies when shrink class is added to navbar
but when shrink is removed, i dont understand 
how the same transition is working here
shouldnt there be a transition in .shrink class so when navbar shifts from shrink to this class... shrink's transition wouldve been used


github rep for portfolio projects

sticky didnt work ... had to use Fixed positioning


used :
    transform
    catching scrolls (for navbar transition)
    scroll behavior (on the whole document (*) | makes scrolling smoother when jumping to sections)
    fixed positioning for sticky effect
    very imp use of parent-relative ---> child-absolute  so child gets free positioning but only relative to the parent
    imp use of border-top/bottom-left/right-radius (give curve to a specific border part only)

    JS and Jquery
    for tech used bar in project section
