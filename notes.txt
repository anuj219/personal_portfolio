i know this transition applies when shrink class is added to navbar
but when shrink is removed, i dont understand 
how the same transition is working here
shouldnt there be a transition in .shrink class so when navbar shifts from shrink to this class... shrink's transition wouldve been used

sticky didnt work ... had to use Fixed positioning


used :
    transform
    catching scrolls (for navbar transition)
    scroll behavior (on the whole document (*) | makes scrolling smoother when jumping to sections)
    fixed positioning for sticky effect
    very imp use of parent-relative ---> child-absolute  so child gets free positioning but only relative to the parent
    imp use of border-top/bottom-left/right-radius (give curve to a specific border part only)

    JS and Jquery

    used input type radio for rating feature in contact from
        had to write the input tag 1st and its label after, so when use ~ on a certain radio btn, all label tags along with its own will also be selected..which was otherwise not selecting
        because if eg
                        label
                        input

                        label        
                        input           (so if we use "~label" on the checked(selected) input tags, all label after that input would be selected)
                        ----------------------
                        input
                        label

                        input
                        label           (in this way, this inputs label will also be selected along with the next ones)

        then had to reverse direction(css property) of the radiobtn div box ... so radio btns go 5 to 1 in the html...but appear 1 to 5 on page
        so isse label and its input ka order back to normal ho jata hai, and when you select a btn (suppose 2nd star), then all labels before this radio btn will be gold (due to ~ and direction rtl on it)

        ~ ---> tidle selector that selects all siblings after an element



    real time rating fetching php code
        had to use if else and flags so as to toggle selection of the first star only.. without it.. 1st star alone could not be unchecked

        wanted the avg rating to be on each page
        so added that php code to footer of template.php
        but when i use require() in the start ... footer comes in the start before host page's content
        so this is an issue !!
        solution: made a footer.php file that stores only the footer code -- place this file using require() at the end of each page.. and voila
